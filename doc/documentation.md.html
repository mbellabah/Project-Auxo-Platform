                        **Developing an Architecture for Multiagent Cyber-Physical Systems; the U.S. Electric Grid and the Proper Compensation of Distributed Energy Resources.**
                           Project Auxo V. 1.0
                            Enabling the meaningful participation of assets at the edge


This project will examine and analyze the behavior of the distribution grid while using a
proposed distribution system retail market, by analyzing it as a cyber-physical multiagent
system. These agents behave as per the distributed optimization methods, security mechanisms,
and market structure outlined in [3] through [5] (See formal research proposal, `.\documents\research_proposal.pdf`). In doing
so, we hope to address the challenge of enabling the secure coordination of diverse and private
assets in an electricity distribution grid, all acting as independent co-operative agents.

Aim to achieve the optimal control of distribution power grids. Project Auxo is building the grid architecture of the future. Project Auxo
Think of cells, or individuals -- we have some primary function -- cells regulate their internals and manage the interface between their membrane, but then contribute to the organ in which they reside.
Imagine the infrastructure needed if 50% of the power generated is consumed at the location

TODO
==================================================================
- [x] Make the workers within the agent multi-threaded
- [ ] Make the workers have some expiration -- expiration is controlled by the agent; i.e it is the agent that chooses when to kill workers -- workers are otherwise persisting
- [ ] Make the workers within an agent
- [ ] Add basic security and authentication features
- [ ] Write the PAC service
- [ ] Write the get state of self services  (LED)
- [ ] Build out the interface to interface with the devices sensors and state

Desired Qualities of the Platform
==================================================================
DER business model looks to provide services and earn revenues at the multiple levels of the system.

* Computation should be concentrated at the edges
* The network should be capable of peer-to-peer connectivity
* Scalable
* Ensure anonymity between the layers; agents and their workers should be anonymous to other agents, agents are anonymous to the clients, and the broker is blind to the peer-to-peer message passing between workers in agents. For the latter-most point, the broker has knowledge of all live workers (including agents as we shall see) on the platform, and may know who is capable of communicating with whom -- that's the extent of it's knowledge. By default, the Apollo broker is unaware of the underlying connections between workers.
* Manage volatility
* Build resilient communities
* Allow for islanding features that maximizes the self-containedness of the islands subject to the physical infrastructure

Overall Design
===================================================================
Project Auxo Apollo is a service-oriented broker platform that interconnects clients, agents, and workers.

Clients make service requests. Services can be simple get requests, requests for sophisticated network monitoring and diagnostics, as well as computation and actuation. Client requests are denoted with the service name, any inputs relevant to the fulfillment of the service; i.e. whether the client expects the service to include the efforts of multiple workers.

Workers are multithreaded processing units that sit within the Agent container. A given worker is tied to a single service, i.e Worker-1 may only provide Service-A. If Agent-1 wanted to respond to several Service-A requests for several clients, it would spawn the equivalent number of Service-A workers. Upon fulfilling the service, the worker saves its state to the local agent, and expires. Worker states and logs are stored locally for 30 days or until the transaction is settled, which ever occurs first. Workers endpoints are defined via `tcp:\\ip_addr:port_num` -- the `port_num` is the only thing that varies among workers in a given agent.

Note that Agent can be thought of a special worker, namely in that it never expires. With that said, all workers, including the agent, when connected to the Apollo broker, heartbeat periodically. The broker aggregates the available services, along with the network address (endpoints) of the relevant workers and passes the worker's peers (those that provide the same service) on each heartbeat acknowledgment. Although a worker could save the endpoints of its peers (and thus know the addressing information of other agents) locally, a worker cannot access a worker in another agent unless their keys match. After the fulfillment of a given service, the Apollo broker will prompt those Agents who participated to change their just-used validation keys. Upon a new service request, and the recreation of the same/similar peer group, the broker shares the network endpoint and key of each peer which is used to validate communication with the worker.

(1) Client-1 requests service A and service B.
(2) Client-1's requests are submitted to the broker (Project Auxo Apollo).
(3) The broker forwards Client-1's requests to those agents who possess workers that can provide said service. The broker randomly elects a leader, Agent-1 for Service-A and Agent-3 for Service-B. Depending on the client's request; namely whether the request requires the coordination of many agents, the broker will indicate that the relevant workers bind to each other in a cooperative peer-to-peer fashion.
(4) All active workers

PAC Thesis Paper Notes
=============================================================
All obtained from Jordan Romvary Paper Thesis -- the majority of the information below is summarized and thus NOT intellectually mine (at least to a meaningful degree).

* Control and regulation of power grids relies on large-scale scedualable generation and stable load demand profiles.
* Renewable technologies and DR methodologies means that new distributed control strategies are needed to better regulate volatile nature of modern generation and load profiles.

* Currently, electric power is generated at generation sites capable of delivering large-scale and scheduable amounts of electric power at 2.3 kV and 30 kV. It's output is then stepped-up (raised to somewhere between 230 kV and 500 kV), and transmitted over large distances using the transmission grid. Substations near the consumer step down the high voltage into primary and secondary power; most household electrical outlets supply secondary power.

**Smarter Power Grids**

* Renewable Energy Resources (RERs): includes wind turbines, PV cells, etc.. Typically connects to the grid at lower voltages, via loads connected to the distribution substation.
* Smart Inverters (SIs): converts solar PV's DC into AC prior to transmitting to the grid. Includes the ability to providing reactive power support and consume/generate power at specified power factors.
* Demand Response (DR): the ability for consumers to react to real-time electric pricing to adjust their loads accordingly.
* Auto-Tap Changers and Adaptive Voltage Regulators: small-scale transformers that can be adjusted to step-up/step-down voltage as need. It is now feasible to network these devices together and cooperatively change their tap settings in conjunction with other regulatory goals -- in theory allows for smoother voltage profile and prevent sagging end-of-line voltage levels.
* Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs): present themselves as large mobile loads that can be sedentary for long periods of time -- may participate in load shaping and other regulatory grid functions.

**Main Challenges**

* newer RER generation is intermittent and thus insufficient for in-advance scheduling.
* Newer load demands are larger and more uncertain.
* An increase in control actuation points means that centralized regulation is becoming computationally infeasible.
Technological and political pressures means that the natural and risk-averse "conservative" solutions, i.e. constrain the penetration of RERs, are inappropriate.

**Power Grid Modeling and Optimization**

Necessary to choose sets of independent and dependent variables, such that the dependent variables follow the independent variables. Two main classes for partitioning grid variables are the branch flow model and the bus injection model. The branch flow model (concerned with branch variables) involves expression non-feeder bus voltages, transmission line currents, and transmission line power flow in terms of bus power injections and feeder voltages. The branch injection model (concerned with bus variables) involves expressing non-feeder bus voltages and bus current injections in terms of bus power injections and feeder voltages. The aforementioned thesis uses the branch flow model.

We define the topological structure of the distribution power grid in the following way:

* $B = \{1,\dots ,N\}$: The set of N buses (or nodes)
* $F \subseteq B$: the set of feeder nodes, the buses connected to the transmission power grid
* $T_d \subseteq B \times B$: the set of directed transmission lines, where $(i, j) \in T_D$ represents $i \to j$
* $\hat{Z_{i,j}} = R_{i,j} + \hat{j}X_{i,j}$: the branch impedance on $(i, j)$, with branch resistance $R_{i,j}$ and branch reactance $X_{i,j}$.
* $\hat{Y_{i,j}} = G_{i,j} - \hat{j}B_{i,j}$: the branch admittance on $(i,j)$ with branch conductance $G_{i,j}$ and branch susceptance $B_{i,j}$
* $N_{US}(j) \triangleq \{i \in B | (i,j) \in T\} \subseteq B$: set of buses upstream of bus j
* $N_{DS}(i) \triangleq \{j \in B | (i,j) \in T\} \subseteq B$: set of buses downstream of bus i

The main variables at each bus for a given bus i:
* $V_i$: bus voltage phasor
* $I_i$: bus current phasor injection into the distributed power grid
* $S_{i}^{G} = P_{i}^{G} + \hat{j}Q_{i}^{G}$: bus power generation phasor, with real power generation and reactive power generation
* $S_{i}^{L} = P_{i}^{L} + \hat{j}Q_{i}^{L}$: bus power consumption phasor, with real power consumption and reactive power consumption
* $S_i = S_{i}^{G} - S_{i}^{L}$: bus power injection into the DPG

And the grid variables along each branch are:
* $V_{i,j} = V_i - V_j$: branch voltage drop
* $I_{i,j}$: branch current flow
* $S_{i,j} = P_{i,j} + \hat{j}Q_{i,j}$: branch power flow, with real and reactive power flow components

As for optimal power flow, the actuation variables are the bus power injects (real and reactive), and the substation/feeder voltage; once these variables are set, the rest of the grid variables, namely branch power/current flows follow accordingly assuming a feasible grid profile exists. This OPF problem may be reformulated as a mathematical optimization problem because of physical and economic constraints, which very briefly are: load generation constraints that limit the real and reactive power outputted by a bus with a given min-max bound. There is also variability with respect to load consumption, naturally, this imposes another constraint. Generation cost and consumption economic constraints can be modeled as convex quadratics in both real/reactive power generation/consumption. There are also energy efficiency considerations, i.e. thermal losses and other energy losses. Please refer to page 88 of the actual thesis for greater detail.


**PAC, in application to the optimal power flow (OPF) problem in power distribution grids**

* PAC enables the full decomposition of the OPF, with all real and reactive power injection decisions being locally determined. Previous approaches involve a centralized entity handling the decision making with minimal autonomy given to the bus entities.
* For power grid optimization: we attempt to choose different power injection profiles that satisfy fixed physical laws.

Formally, we model the the optimization problem as:
\begin{equation}
   \min_{x\in R}f(\mathbf{x}), s.t.: h(\mathbf{x; u}) \leq \mathbf{0}, g(\mathbf{x; u}) = \mathbf{0}
\end{equation}
Where $\mathbf{x} \in R^N$ are the local choices that influence the underlying system. $\mathbf{u} \in U$ are the external changes that affect how the environment changes. The functions h and g are the constraints on the feasible choices for X. $f(\cdot)$ is a metric describing how our choices affect the system's performance, i.e. the objective function.
